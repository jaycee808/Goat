## Overview

I created and designed Goat, a website dedicated to men's skincare and fragrance. Goat integrates stylish design with intuitive features to offer an smooth online shopping experience. The website presents a sleek and user-friendly interface, enabling visitors to explore different categories and products. Goat prioritises both visual appeal and user-friendliness, ensuring that customers can browse, search, and complete purchases with ease.
