## Overview

I designed and developed Goat, a website dedicated to men's skincare and fragrance. Goat integrates stylish design with intuitive features to offer a smooth online shopping experience. The website presents a sleek and user-friendly interface, enabling visitors to explore different categories and products. Goat prioritises both visual appeal and user-friendliness, ensuring that customers can browse, search, and complete purchases with ease.
